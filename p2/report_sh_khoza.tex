\section{\textbf{Introduction }}
In March 2022, I accepted an offer in IT Graduate with Copalcor, effective from 1 March 2022 to 28 February 2023. Copalcor is South Africa's largest manufacturer of copper, brass, alloy-based semi-finished products, and turnkey busbar systems. I am more than grateful to be part of copalcor
\\
\\
Copalcor offers clients solutions of a wide range from extruded, rolled, and forged non-ferrous metal products. Copalcor undertakes local and international projects from design to manufacture and installation when required. The manufacturing facilities include Extruding, Forging, Rolling, and Casting.
\\
\\
The head office and manufacturing facilities are located at Wadeville, Germiston, near Johannesburg in South Africa. Established in 1948, the company has undergone various name changes from McKechnie Brothers, Brass Extruders (BESA), and Copalcor Rolled Metals (CRM) to the current Copalcor Group. Copalcor is a Supporting Member of the CDAA (Copper Development Association Africa) and is active on the CDAA's board.
\\

\section{\textbf{Background } }
Copalcor being an old company, means they still use an old way to complete task.
This part of the reason the are investing on a software development teams to
improve the operation of day to day business with a help. Thats where I come in.

\subsection{The nature of department}
The department I work close with was the forging department. The main responsibility
was forging copper, hence the name. They also manufacure carpentry to packge the 
finish products to their clients

\subsection{Problem Statement}
As a software developer , I was tasked to reasearch on how can reduce paper work from
the employee, Another problemm they face is mananging excel spreadsheet. since it has to be 
edited by more thatn one person and to keep track of the changes it became a chalaage

\subsection{My Duties}
My responsibiiy range from IT Desk suppoert to Software development. Working at
Copalcor I anssited on helping employee that they are connect to the wife, and 
can recieve emails. Createing intternet cable to connect the computers and 
maintain cellphone. I was give projece to develop with sofware and present the
solution to the management.

\section{\textbf{Personal role at workplace} }
I believe I had an exicting role at work ever, I got to present the project I was
working to the directors. I have worked with talent Engineers
not only in Software but Elecronics and Mentallagy. The first tree months I 
was tasked to Develop an Metal Purchasing Application and Presenting my progress
every week to my boos

\subsection{Metal Purchasing Application}
The purpose of this application was to help my boss with managing alloy orders, but
it end up helping more people since you can not only placed order. You can 
recieve Order and generate report on the application. Before the application
when you place an order you had to manual edit a spreadsheet of the order 
you created, and send an email to the supplier and the relavent people within
the company to notify them. Metal Purchasing Applicatin simplify this by 
automatica sending email to the relavent application when you create an Order and
take the burdening of editing the spreadshet.

\subsubsection{How I Develop The Application}
My thing that TUT teach me was progaraming, I love programing and I also love
solving problem with programming skills. For this application I use .NET 5
framework to develop the application with C\# Programming language. Although
at school I study C++ as my programming language, I choose this one because
of the job market here in South Africa. The is a lot of demand for Junior
Software Developer who can programe in .NET 5 than C++.
\\
\\
To make it simple for myself, I used HTML template to quickly implement 
user interface. The template I use is Admin LTE develop with bootsrap, javescript
CSS. I was quickly to understand the template since I had experience working
with bootsrap buiding my personal project. One challage that I faced when 
working with this template was how to generate form dynamic and allow them to
send data to the backend C\# code. With help from the internet I manage to 
solve this my writing a javacrip code that geneate code when the user click
a button
\\
\\
Conneting to the database was handle my Microsoft Entity Framwork. This 
package help to connect to the database secure, create database table
for you and manage migration for you application. The package helped me
since I did not have to write SQL queryies manual instead I write 
C\# code that generate the query for myself. This design solution is
called Code first approach. 
\\
\\
We went through variouse ways on how we can host the web application, 
Copalcor had and on-site sever. We first hosted the appliction there but
that meant you can only connect to the appllicaton when you are on copalcor
premises. My boss wanted to use the application even when he is not on site,
so we wanted to work with clound. I move the appliction to microsoft azure it turns
out is more expensive. I then finaly hosted the application on linode sever
That I manage ourself. It was much cheaper to host the application this ways
since 


\subsection{Carpentry Shop}
As I mention above copalcor employees deals with a lot of paper work and 
the goal is to elimate those paper work. This time was with the Carpenty 
Shop Application. Every deparment they have to fill a form when palcing 
for the capernety shop then someone has to manual process the order and
give to the person creating the carpenty. The is no way of telling 
when is complete, since is a paper based system also it is hard to track
when the order is lost. I was tasked to develop a application to solve 
this problem as well. 
\\
\\
\subsubsection{How I Develop The Application}
Similar to the Metal Purchasing application, I used .NET 6 for this application
because at the time of writing this, .NET 6 is the stable version of the
framework. .Net 6 change few things around, it not quite similar to .Net 5. 
This gave me chance to learn new things and I love learning new technologies
\\
\\
I used sematic UI to develop the user interface of the application, it is 
clean and simple. sematic UI is just like bootsrap with opiniotaed design
and it also take this futher giving you validation handles. Making the developer 
easy to design beautiful design quick. I enjoy working with sematic UI and I 
think for now is my go to UI library when devloping web applliacation
\\
\\
Since this appliction is not big as Metal Purchasing application, I used 
SQlite database instead of mariaDB. Sqlite it is fast simple and can be 
stored on a USB. The dreawback of sqlite dont't opposee a treate for this 
application since the data is not confidetail. Sending email to the person
who place the order is implement using the MailKit libray, a cross platform
libray to send email with C# and is open source.
\\
\\
Similar to Metal Purchasing application Cartpenty Shop application is 
hosted on Linode sever running appacher. This decision was so I can manage the two
applicatin easy.
