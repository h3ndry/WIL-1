\section{\textbf{Introduction }}
In March 2021, I was a pointed as an Information Technology(IT) Intern on a twelve(12) months internship program at \href{http://www.thehorizon.co.za/}{The Horizon}. The program was in partnership with Melonz Media and \href{http://www.sita.co.za/page/about}{SITA}. The following report detail the experience I have gained during the first six months of the program.

\section{\textbf{Background } }
The Digital Academy’s main focus is to create innovative digital products. While I was working at The Digital Academy, I was working under the IT  support,  systems department. This department is involved in developing and maintaining  internal systems necessary for perfect communication and work. It creates plans to improve the overall efficiency and productivity of the company. Most of this work is software development of applications.

 % The objective of our department is to ensure fast communications, data processing and market intelligence. Helping the company to improve business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Most of the products created at The Digital Academy are for the partners of the company.

% While working at The Digital Academy my main task was developing web applications to solve real life problems we are faced as a country. My duties included analysing and understanding the given problem statement then doing research to know more about the problem. Once the research part was completed I then went down to planning the best possible way of solving the problem that was presented to me. This included using visual texts and diagrams such as entity relation diagrams to figure out a solution. Critical thinking and good communication amongst me and my team members were very important when coming to this. 

% After planning then came the implementation part of the planned solution. I mostly did this using visual studio code IDE. Testing would then be done by our mentors followed by the deployment of the projects. 

\section{\textbf{Personal role at workplace} }
My responsibility at The Horizon includes, but is not limited to, Analyse user needs, design, test, and develop software to meet those needs. Provide technical support, analyze and resolve IT issues. Create and updates documentation concerning all system changes.

\subsection{Class Enrollment Application}
During the first month of my intern program at The Horizon, I was introduced to Microsoft Visual C\# in a training with \href{https://mecerintered.co.za/}{Meccer Inter-Ed}. Microsoft Visual C\# is one of the technologies The Horizon uses to solve business problem for their client and within the Company.

After the training, I was tasked to develop a Class Enrollment Application. The application was for windows desktop users and developed using the same technology I learned in the training. The application was for enrolling students in a class, enable an administrator to add and remove students from a class, as well update the detail of the students. Developing the application gave me hands-on experience in software development. I have gained technical skills in Microsoft Visual C\# including, but not limited to:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,partopsep=0pt,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt]
	\item Creating an entity model for accessing a database and use LNQ to query data
	\item Integrate unmanaged libraries and dynamic components into Visual C\# application
	\item Encrypt and decrypt data by using symmetric and asymmetric encryption
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Photo Sharing Web application}
The second project I worked on, introduced me to API. API is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. I used an API for my covid application which gives information about countries’ current covid 19 statistics. The application starts with a list of all the countries’ names and flags in an alphabetic order. 
When a flag or name of a certain country is clicked, the application navigates to another page and a detailed information about that country’s covid 19 statistics information shows up. The information that shows up is the country’s current infected cases on the first card, the second card shows the country’s recovery cases, the third card shows death cases the country experienced and the last card highlights the percentage of the population of the country that is infected from the total percentage of the country’s population. Below the cards is a graphical representation of the above mentioned information in a pie chart.

\subsection{Phila Health Web Application}
This application was the first application I did which worked from end to end. I worked on the frontend of the project and the backend which acted as the middleware to connect to the database. For this specific project I build the frontend using angular , the backend using node js and the database I used was Mongo DB. I used express to create and connect to the server and mongoose helped me to connect to the database. 
The application allowed users to write up their to-do list and one was able to add a task and that task will be added to a list, one was also able to delete a task if it was added by mistake. Once a task was complete by a user, the user could checkout that specific  task. All this data was saved at the database.
